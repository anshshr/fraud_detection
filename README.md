## Overview
FraudShield is an advanced fraud detection system that identifies and prevents fraudulent transactions in real time. By leveraging AI-powered anomaly detection, risk evaluation models, and automated alerts, FraudShield enhances financial security and reduces fraud-related losses.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Instantly analyzes transaction data to detect anomalies.
- **AI-Powered Risk Evaluation**: Uses machine learning models to assess fraud probability.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Web and mobile app integration for easy access.
- **Automated Notifications**: Alerts users and authorities when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves fraud detection accuracy through AI training.
- **Enhanced User Behavior Analytics** using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for handling API requests efficiently.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow & Scikit-Learn for training fraud detection models.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing transactional data securely.
- **Frontend**: Flutter for building cross-platform (Android & iOS) mobile apps.
- **LangChain & LangServe**: Used for intelligent data processing and response generation.

## Realistic Challenges Faced
1. **Data Quality & Availability**: Ensuring a diverse and representative dataset for training models.
2. **Latency Issues**: Optimizing real-time fraud detection while maintaining high accuracy.
3. **False Positives & Negatives**: Balancing precision and recall to minimize incorrect alerts.
4. **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can handle large transaction volumes.
5. **Security & Compliance**: Adhering to financial regulations like PCI DSS.
